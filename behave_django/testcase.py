"""
TestCase classes to prevent unit tests from being executed.

We want to run Behave under the hood instead of unit tests.
We do this by disabling the setup, teardown and fixture loading methods
of Django's TestCase classes. This way we can reuse what the Django
project adds to Python's unittest setup, yet having full total control
over the test execution.

Django 5.2 changed ``_pre_setup`` and ``_fixture_setup`` to classmethods,
hence the conditional handling below.
See https://github.com/django/django/commit/8eca3e9b
